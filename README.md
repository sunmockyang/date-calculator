# date-calculator

A minuscule tool for doing date calculations with basic natural language support. First add in your starting date, and then either add or subtract time, or add a second date. We'll do the rest, and give you a range of useful time formats. Created for fun, modified for the [10k apart contest](https://a-k-apart.com).

__The page currently sits at 3.7KB after minification + gzipping__

## What we did to squeeze our website into as few kibbles as possible:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript minification
- As much JavaScript encapsulation as possible to get maximum minification.
- Minimal class/variable names
- Gzipping

## Installation
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `node app.js` to run the server

## Compilation:
Run `make`, which will run our ruby script to generate index.html (minified), and index.html.gz (minified + gzipped)

### Ruby gems used:
- [HTML Press](https://github.com/stereobooster/html_press)
- [CSS Minify](https://github.com/matthiassiegel/cssminify)
- [Uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier)
